# HANG-MAN-GAME
The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It challenges players to guess a secret word by guessing one letter at a time. The game interface will be intuitive and visually appealing, enhancing the user experience while providing a fun and engaging gaming environment.

Key Features:

User Interface: The game will have a simple and attractive user interface using HTML and CSS. It will display the hangman drawing, the hidden word represented by dashes, a list of guessed letters, and the remaining attempts.

Random Word Generation: The game will randomly select a word from a predefined list of words for each round. This ensures that each playthrough offers a different word for guessing.

Word Display: The hidden word will be displayed using dashes, with each dash representing an unknown letter. As the player correctly guesses letters, the corresponding dashes will be replaced with the revealed letters.

Hangman Drawing: The game will include a visual representation of a hangman that changes as the player makes incorrect guesses. The hangman's elements (head, body, arms, and legs) will appear sequentially, increasing the suspense and challenge.

Win and Lose Conditions: The game will have win and lose conditions. The player wins if they successfully guess the entire word before running out of attempts. The player loses if the hangman drawing is completed before guessing the word.

Reset and Play Again: After a game ends (whether in a win or a loss), the player will have the option to reset the game and play again with a new randomly selected word.

Technology Stack:

HTML: For creating the game layout and structure.

CSS: For styling the user interface and making it visually appealing.

JavaScript: For implementing the game logic, handling user interactions, and managing the game state.
